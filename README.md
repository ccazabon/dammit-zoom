## Dammit, Zoom!

This is a very simple web browser extension to eliminate Zoom's annoying 
insistence on you opening every meeting link in their desktop applications.
Why install a bloated, buggy, proprietary application when the web client
does everything you want?

It's particularly annoying on Linux, because
* it prompts you every time to open the app with xdg-open
* their app is crap; it hard-locks a lot of systems I've tried it on

With this extension, every Zoom meeting link will be redirected to the web
client join page for the meeting.

This works on Blink-based browsers (Chrome, Vivaldi, Brave, etc).  It 
should also work on Safari, and possibly on Firefox and others.
